A c structure is always 128 bytes.Generally size of a c structure is calculated manually by adding 
the size of each member field or we can directly use sizeof() operator to calculate its size.
for example
struct data
{
    char name[20];
    int age;
    int weight;
    int class;
    int rollno;

} s;
the size of this structure : 36
char datatype : 1 byte       int datatype : 4 byte
so its 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36;
